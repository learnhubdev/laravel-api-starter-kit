# Laravel API Starter Kit

An opinionated Software-as-a-Service Laravel API Starter Kit for long-term projects inspired by the tactical patterns from Domain-Driven Design.

Things to do before releasing the v1 officially:

- [ ] Review the folder structure to see if it can be improved
- [ ] Implement authentication for both Sanctum single page app and mobile versions
- [x] Implement member signups
- [ ] Implement forgot password
- [ ] Implement password confirmation
- [ ] Implement teams
- [ ] Implement 2-factor authentication
- [ ] Implement profile management
- [ ] Implement a caching strategy
- [ ] Set up testing
- [ ] Set up mutation testing (infection PHP)
- [ ] Set up PHPStan
- [ ] Set up Deptrac
- [ ] Set up PHPArkitect 
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions to run all of the code quality tools automatically on new pull requests
- [ ] Update the documentation to add information about the package, what it is, why it's being built, how to use it and what are the rules that need to be followed in order to make the package worth using as a starting point for long-term Laravel apps
- [ ] Think of new features to add for v2 and beyond
